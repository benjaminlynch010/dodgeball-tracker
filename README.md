# Dodgeball-Stat-Tracker

## Introduction
*Duration: 2 Week Sprint*

Welcome to our dodgeball stat tracker, progressive web application.  This application is the brain-child of Will Buck. An avid, and passionate Dodgeballer. As well as an accomplished software engineer, as well. The application’s goal is to allow dodgeball players, officials, and attendees of tournaments, to track player/game statistics. Dodgeball is a fast paced game, and often in locations that may not have the best network connection. This app aims to address this, by providing a quick and intuitive user interface. Designed with tournament organizers in mind, this app simplifies the management of tournaments, teams, and players. As a progressive web app, it can be used offline, overcoming the challenge of unreliable cell service in dodgeball venues.
